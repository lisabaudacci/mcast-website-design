            <p>MCAST's relationship with industry stimulates the College's success. Its programmes are flexible,
                relevant, and responsive to the aspirations of the students and to the needs of industries which are
                constantly evolving to meet the challenges of a changing global economy.</p>
            <p>The College supports small and medium-sized enterprises through a multidisciplinary approach. This
                encompasses work-based learning through the Apprenticeships Programme, the various entrepreneurship
                initiatives, and through MG2i (MCAST's commercial arm) services whereby it provides training courses
                tailor-made to their needs.</p>
